# Git-Commits-Assignment
This is for a assignment in DGM 260R
I am going to use my assignment as a way to track My Recently made RPG "Heros of The Third Planet".
This is based in a world I created over the years and made a story surrounding a hero Who Is named Corlon. 
I created him when I was in the 1st grade and originally named him Catredknightman. (I still call him that when talking to those who don't know I gave him a real name).
He weilds the legendary Creator Warclaws and is a cathuman with blood red hair and usually wearing a matching tunic.
His original Name (Catredknightman) are now a title in the Warclawion Warrior ranks. Cat for race, Red for color, Knight for position,and Man for gender.
The Warclaion Warriors are all cathumans. They all weild Warclaws and each has a unique color. Infact only one of a color can be alive at a time and it is inherated into the blood line for the warrior's decendent to wield their warclaws if they die. Of course they can only do that if they have the same color or a new one apears. Corlon is the only one to ever be Red.
In a breif amount of History the ancient war between the Cathumans and Doghumans has gone for a long time. Thousands of years infact.
The doghumans wanted more power and the cathumans did their best to hold them back. With superior tech the Cathumans could match the Larger build and larger numbers of the Doghumans.
To get a upper edge the Cathumans then tried to colonize the third planet in the system, Funny cause that is what everyone called it... The Third Planet. The ship crashed and the colony lost all its advanced tech causing them to start over. In time they regained contact with the other Cathumans and where soon attacked by the doghumans who had turned almost savage and Evil. In order to protect them the original Cathumans sent the Warclawion Warriors to the planet and eventually the story leads to Corlon being born after his father, the Original leader, gets married.
When I first created Catredknightman, I made a game I played with my friends where we would play outside as our character me being Catredknightman, and them who ever their character was. It was fun and helped me develop a story to this world. Of course I still have to fix some things before its perfect.
With the advanced amount of magic and technology all Anamalions can live for a very long amount of time. For example Cat humans can live to be 100,000 years old if they are healthy and not killed, and sometimes longer then that.
I plan on eventually making this story into a Video game. I probably will have to revise and edit some things to make it work.
I will have to fix the enemies so they can take more then one hit.
If you enjoyed this little peek at the game go ahead and let me know and I will tell you more.
