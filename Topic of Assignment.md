# Git-Commits-Assignment
This is for a assignment in DGM 260R
I am going to use my assignment as a way to track My Recently made RPG "Heros of The Third Planet".
This is based in a world I created over the years and made a story surrounding a hero Who Is named Corlon. 
I created him when I was in the 1st grade and originally named him Catredknightman. (I still call him that when talking to those who don't know I gave him a real name).
He weilds the legendary Creator Warclaws and is a cathuman with blood red hair and usually wearing a matching tunic.
His original Name (Catredknightman) are now a title in the Warclawion Warrior ranks. Cat for race, Red for color, Knight for position,and Man for gender.
The Warclaion Warriors are all cathumans. They all weild Warclaws and each has a unique color. Infact only one of a color can be alive at a time and it is inherated into the blood line for the warrior's decendent to wield their warclaws if they die. Of course they can only do that if they have the same color or a new one apears. Corlon is the only one to ever be Red.
