# Git-Commits-Assignment
This is for a assignment in DGM 260R
I am going to use my assignment as a way to track My Recently made RPG "Heros of The Third Planet".
This is based in a world I created over the years and made a story surrounding a hero Who Is named Corlon. 
I created him when I was in the 1st grade and originally named him Catredknightman. (I still call him that when talking to those who don't know I gave him a real name).
He weilds the legendary Creator Warclaws and is a cathuman with blood red hair and usually wearing a matching tunic.
